##About
Introduction of User Story and User Story Mapping

## What is User Story?
It is a description of a business requirement from end to end in a system. It is used to facilitate discussion on under
Usually written in a index card in the format:
1. *In order to (benefit) As a (role) I want to (action)*
	or
2. *As a (role) I want to (action) so that I can (benefit)*

There are scrum teams prefer the 1st format as they will focus more on user's goal/issue that want to resolve than the action/solution being taken.

User stories can be generated by stakeholder, team member or product owner.
Those user stories will be generated and grouped as a backlog.

### Drawbacks of a flat product backlog
1. Many user stories that cannot be correlated to each other. No big picture.
2. It is not easy to making decision on priority as there is no direction on product development.
3. Making Release plan may be difficult.


## What is User Story Mapping?
It is a way to organise and prioritise user stories. It is useful to determine release roadmap and provide a big picture of a product.

Big stories are called user activities. Then those activities make up a horizontal backbone.

###Create story map
1. Frame the problem
  * What problem is the website going to resolve. 
  * Who are the users. Persona can be used to identify users.
2. Map the big picture
  * Brainstorm to list out all the tasks. 
  * Group the task into activities
3. Explore
  * Arrange left to right, examine any missing/alternative/exception tasks
  * Find out walking skeleton: the software built of the least number of necessary tasks
4. Slice out a release strategy
  * Must-have -> one-dimensional (The more I get the better) -> delighters (I love the element of the product)
5. Slide out a learning strategy
  * After slide out must-have, also identify the outcome which want to achieve on solving the problem frame in the first step. 
6. Slide out a development strategy
  * Opening Game: Bare Necessity 
  * Mid-Game: Capability & Flexibility -> Safety 
  * End Game: Usability, Performance
