[Datatables](https://www.datatables.net/) is an excellent jquery plug-in that generated flexible and useful table(s). It has lots of build-in function for tables generated, such as ordering, searching, pagination. However, when binding an event to a element inside the table generated by Datatables, it will be disappear after the tables redrawn. This post is to resolve this issue.


#Example

Suppose we have following table in Html

```html
<table id="example">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Position</th>
            <th>Office</th>
            <th>Age</th>
            <th>Start date</th>
            <th>Salary</th>
            <th>Action</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Tiger Nixon</td>
            <td>System Architect</td>
            <td>Edinburgh</td>
            <td>61</td>
            <td>2011/04/25</td>
            <td>$320,800</td>
            <th><button name="btnEdit">edit<button></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Garrett Winters</td>
            <td>Accountant</td>
            <td>Tokyo</td>
            <td>63</td>
            <td>2011/07/25</td>
            <td>$170,750</td>
            <th><button name="btnEdit">edit<button></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Ashton Cox</td>
            <td>Junior Technical Author</td>
            <td>San Francisco</td>
            <td>66</td>
            <td>2009/01/12</td>
            <td>$86,000</td>
            <th><button name="btnEdit">edit<button></th>
        </tr>
    <tbody>
<table>
```

And javascript is as following
```javascript
$().ready(function () {
    var t = $('#example').DataTable();
    $("[name=btnEdit]").click(function(e) {
        // do edit function 
    });
});
```

# Problem
The **Edit** button will be working when this table is shown. However, if we using the search function to filter the content of table, we will find that the **Edit** button is not functioning. 


# Solutions
To resolve this issue, there are two solutions:
1. put the javascript function inside html, for example:
    ```html
    <button name="btnEdit" onclick="edit(this)">edit<button>
    ```
2. rebinding the event on **Edit** button when search event fired. We also could rebind event after table redrawn since after search, draw event is fired as well. Example is
    ```javascript
    $().ready(function () {
        $('#example').on('draw.dt', function(){        
            $("[name=btnEdit]").unbind("click").click(function(e) {
                // do edit function 
            });
        ).DataTable();
    });
    ```
    There is a `Unbind("click")` is called to avoid keeping binding same event on the **Edit** button since the tables is redrawn on every *keypress* event on the *search* input box.
