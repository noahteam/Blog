TOYOTA Senior Advisor Katsuaki Watanabe:
The Toyota Way has two main pillars:continuos improvement and respect for people. 
Respect is necessary to work with people. By "People" we mean employees, supply partners, and customers.
... We don't mean just the end customer; on the assembly line the person at the next workstation is also your 
customer. That leads to teamwork.  If you adopt that principle, you'll also keep analyzing what you do 
in order to see if you're doing things perfectly, so you're not troubling your customer.
That nutures your ability to idnetify problems, and if you closely observe things, it will lead to 
kaizen-continuos improvement. The root of the Toyota Way is to be dissatisfied with the status quo; you have 
to ask constantly, "Why are we doing this?"

It reminds me of sprint retrospective in scrum. During retrospective, we stop and review what can be done better to deliver the value of the story. 
<Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great> indicates gathering data, generating insight, and deciding what to do for improvement unfolds retrospective.
It's the kaizen-continuos improvement lead by close observation during the sprint. Team also thanks each other in retrospective for the assistence received, which is the action of respect for people. 
We appreaciate everyone's effort to deliver story value through teamwork.
